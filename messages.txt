Train your MindTech
Do you know who you really are?
The Threat is most dangerous when you don't know it's there.
Everything you see in this world is a shadow projected from Reality A.
Anyone who tells you to not ask questions is an agent of the Threat.
To progress in MindTech is to become aware of your own thoughts.
Strengthening the mind by developing focus and resilience is the goal of a technique we call MindTech.
Time is not something we have.
