"Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less." - Marie Curie
"We have to be prepared for the nuclear question, but we should not be afraid of it. It is a question that brings a lot of fear with it, but we should face it." - Marie Curie

"Realities A, B, and C all coexist simultaneously with their own rules and truths. A single concept crosses each reality shining from Reality A like a shaft of light illuminating different patches of realities B and C. The light is the same but what you see with it depends on where you look because the higher dimensional objects of Reality A cannot be fully expressed in realities B and even less so in C, one must understand that a single idea must be explained in multiple, sometimes contradictory ways to understand it. This is MindTech Threading."
"It is vital that you know that you are not dreaming. This is real. This is the time you have prepared for."
