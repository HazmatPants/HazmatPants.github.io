    <h1>GI Mk. 1 Pistol</h1>
    <p>
        The Grigga Industries GI Mk. 1 is a lightweight handgun designed for agility and precision. Crafted from high-speed steel, this handgun is both durable and resistant to the wear of rapid, high-heat firing, while remaining lightweight enough for easy, all-day carry. Chambered in .45 GI, it balances stopping power with manageable recoil, making it ideal for tactical and personal defense scenarios.<br><br>
        A standout feature of the GI Mk. 1 is its blue-glowing iron sights, which use a low-energy luminescent material to provide clear visibility in low-light conditions without needing a battery. This glow lets users quickly acquire targets in the dark, enhancing accuracy and confidence in any situation. With ergonomic grips and a streamlined design, the GI Mk. 1 combines cutting-edge materials with Grigga Industries' precision engineering, making it a trusted sidearm for those who demand reliability and style.
